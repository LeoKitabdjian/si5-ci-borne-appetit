# Borne'Appetit

This is a Backend For Frontend designed for Borne'Appetit(BA) app.

I work mainly like gateway between [Micro Restaurant](https://github.com/collet/micro-restaurant-public)
and the client (Borne).

To use this application, you need to up Micro Restaurant app first and then 
`docker-compose up bff` to start this application inside docker container.

### Notice

Set the gateway url if GATEWAY_URL != "http://localhost:9500"
